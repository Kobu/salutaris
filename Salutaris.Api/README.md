To start the project run:
- `dotnet ef database update` after installing all the dependencies
- uncomment line 27 to seed the database
- run the application

Postman collection containing the seeded data can be imported for easier testability

Some endpoints require a valid JWT token - this token can be generated with the Authorize User request
